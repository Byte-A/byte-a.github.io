         <div class="imagewrapper" style="width:200px;"><a href="https://repear-squad.github.io"><img src="assets/img/74072833.png"/></a><p>I also work part-time for RePear Squad, which is a PC building and PC repair company. I still don't work there full time, so if your looking to hire me, this will not interfere in a potential job.</p></div>
